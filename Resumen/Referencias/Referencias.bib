  abstract = {A simple mechanical one-dimensional problem in the context of nonlocal (integral) elasticity is solved analytically. The nonlocal elastic material behaviour is described by the "Eringen model" whose nonlocality features all reside in the constitutive relation. This relation, of integral type, contains an attenuation function (usually assumed symmetric) aimed to capture the diffusion process of the nonlocality effects; it also exhibits a convolution format. The governing equation is a Fredholm integral equation of second kind whose analytical treatment, even for the usual choice of a symmetric kernel, is not easy to develop. In the present paper, assuming a specific shape for the attenuation function, a closed form solution in terms of strains is alternatively obtained by solving a Volterra integral equation of second kind. The latter can be easily solved with standard techniques, at least for the adopted kernel, taking also advantage from the symmetry of the solution. Such a closed form solution is an essential result to validate the effectiveness of numerical procedures aimed to solve more complex mechanical problems in the context of nonlocal elasticity. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Non-local continuum mechanics allows one to account for the small length scale effect that becomes significant when dealing with microstructures or nanostructures. This paper presents some simplified non-local elastic beam models, for the bending analyses of small scale rods. Integral-type or gradient non-local models abandon the classical assumption of locality, and admit that stress depends not only on the strain value at that point but also on the strain values of all points on the body. There is a paradox still unresolved at this stage: some bending solutions of integral-based non-local elastic beams have been found to be identical to the classical (local) solution, i.e. the small scale effect is not present at all. One example is the Euler-Bernoulli cantilever nanobeam model with a point load which has application in microelectromechanical systems and nanoelectromechanical systems as an actuator. In this paper, it will be shown that this paradox may be overcome with a gradient elastic model as well as an integral non-local elastic model that is based on combining the local and the non-local curvatures in the constitutive elastic relation. The latter model comprises the classical gradient model and Eringen's integral model, and its application produces small length scale terms in the non-local elastic cantilever beam solution. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {In this paper the physically-based approach to non-local elasticity theory is introduced. It is formulated by reverting the continuum to an ensemble of interacting volume elements. Interactions between adjacent elements are classical contact forces while long-range interactions between non-adjacent elements are modelled as distance-decaying central body forces. The latter are proportional to the relative displacements rather than to the strain field as in the Eringen model and subsequent developments. At the limit the displacement field is found to be governed by an integro-differential equation, solved by a simple discretization procedure suggested by the underlying mechanical model itself, with corresponding static boundary conditions enforced in a quite simple form. It is then shown that the constitutive law of the proposed model coalesces with the Eringen constitutive law for an unbounded domain under suitable assumptions, whereas it remains substantially different for a bounded domain. Thermodynamic consistency of the model also has been investigated in detail and some numerical applications are presented for different parameters and different functional forms for the decay of the long range forces. For simplicity, the problem is formulated for a 1D continuum while the general formulation for a 3D elastic solid has been reported in the appendix. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The proper understanding of the nonclassical behavior of nanostructures is key for the design of these devices. As a result, the static and dynamic behavior of nanoscale beam structures has received a great attention in the past few years. This review aims at directing the light to research work concerned with bending, buckling, vibrations, and wave propagation of nanobeams modeled according to the nonlocal elasticity theory of Eringen. Due to the large body of references found in the literature, the authors chose to briefly present the key findings and challenges and direct light to possible future work.

The present research introduces an appropriate thermodynamically consistent model allowing for the higher-order strain gradient effects within the nonlocal theory of elasticity. The thermodynamic framework for third-grade nonlocal elastic materials is developed and employed to establish the Helmholtz free energy and the associated constitutive equations. Establishing the minimum total potential energy principle, the integro-differential conditions of dynamic equilibrium along with the associated classical and higher-order boundary conditions are derived and comprehensively discussed. A rigorous formulation of the third-grade nonlocal elastic Bernoulli–Euler nano-beam is also presented. A novel series solution based on the modified Chebyshev polynomials is introduced to examine the flexural response of the size-dependent beam. The proposed size-dependent beam model is demonstrated to reveal the stiffening or softening flexural behaviors, depending on the competitions of the characteristic length-scale parameters. The higher-order gradients of strain fields are illustrated to have more dominant effects on the beam stiffening.},

This approach is named the nonlocal Ritz method (NL-RM). This feature greatly reduces the computational cost compared to the nonlocal finite-element method (NL-FEM). Another advantage of this approach is that, unlike NL-FEM, the nonlocal mass and stiffness matrices are independent of the mesh distribution. Here, these formulations are applied to study the static-bending and free-dynamic analyses of the Kirchhoff plate model. In this paper, novel 2D BCOPs of the plate are derived as coordinate functions. These polynomials are generated using a modified Gram-Schmidt process and satisfy the given geometrical boundary conditions as well as the natural boundary conditions. The accuracy and convergence of the presented model, demonstrated through several numerical examples, are discussed. A concise argument on the advantages of NL-RM compared to NL-FEM is also provided.},

However, this formulation shows some inconsistencies that are not completely understood. In this paper we formulate the problem of the static bending of Euler-Bernoulli beams using the Eringen integral constitutive equation. It is shown that, in general, the Eringen model in differential form is not equivalent to the Eringen model in integral form, and a general method to solve the problem rigorously in integral form is proposed. Beams with different boundary and load conditions are analyzed and the results are compared with those derived from the differential approach showing that they are different in general. With this integral formulation, the paradox that appears when solving the cantilever beam with the differential form of the Eringen model (increase in stiffness with the nonlocal parameter) is solved, which is one of the main contributions of the present work.},

The algorithmic implementation of the framework is discussed, and its performance is thoroughly investigated. Mesh sensitivity studies reveal that the proposed approach eliminates mesh-dependent strain localization and leads to objective global (i.e., load displacement) and local (i.e., curvature profile) response in the presence of concrete softening. Comparison with historical test data from 24 column specimens shows that the postpeak response of RC beam-columns is predicted with reasonable accuracy. The limitations of the presented framework are discussed along with areas for further development.},

  abstract = {Steel beam-columns subjected to cyclic loading (such as during earthquakes) may exhibit local buckling, which results in effective cross-sectional softening and localization of deformation. These phenomena are critical from the standpoint of performance and collapse assessment. Fiber-based elements are attractive for simulating beam-column response because they capture P-M interactions and the spread of plasticity and can be generalized to different cross sections from material-level calibrations. However, conventional fiber models typically employ softening constitutive material laws to represent local buckling. Without a regularizing length scale, this results in a nonelliptic boundary-value problem, leading to severe mesh dependence. A two-dimensional nonlocal fiber-based beam-column model is presented to address this issue for steel wide-flange sections subject to combinations of axial and cyclic lateral loads. The methodology includes the following elements: (1) a constitutive material model that is able to represent inelastic cyclic local buckling, (2) a nonlocal strain formulation that incorporates a physically based length scale, and (3) suggested practices for input selection and parameter calibration. Forty-two continuum finite-element models (encompassing a range of parameters including cross section, axial load ratio, moment gradient, and loading history) are constructed to inform as well as validate the presented methodology. The methodology simulates various aspects (load-deformation response, localized deformation, and column axial shortening) with accuracy and without mesh dependence. This is in contrast to conventional fiber models that exhibit severe mesh dependence. Limitations are discussed.},

  abstract = {The nonlocal continuum theory, either integral or differential form, has been formulated, evolved and widely used in our era to explain size effect phenomena in micro– and nano– structures. In the case of Euler Bernoulli beam theory (EBBT), the nonlocal integral form produces energy consistent formulas, unlike the nonlocal differential form revealing inconsistencies and giving rise to paradoxes. In this work, our overall research objective mainly focuses on nonlocal integral elasticity analysis of beams by employing a normalized symmetric kernel. This kernel corresponds to a finite domain (and will be called modified kernel from now on), that satisfies all the properties of a probability density function as well as successfully handles the physical inconsistencies of classic types of kernel. Our concern is to investigate the static response of a beam with various types of loading and boundary conditions (BCs) by making use the modified kernel and the kernel corresponding to the two phase nonlocal integral (TPNI) model. Carrying out numerical methods to our problems, the deducing results appear more flexible behavior than those of classic-local and the common nonlocal differential, respectively. What is more, a comparison is made between the results of the aforementioned kernels to demonstrate the advantages of the modified kernel. Unlike the common nonlocal differential form, the nonlocal integral forms do not give rise to paradoxes. Moreover, it is critical that the TPNI model does not raise paradoxes as has been observed in other publications presented in the literature.},

  abstract = {The strain energy of a deformed material with spatial interaction can be written either in a differential (multipolar) form, i.e. as a single volume integral containing displacement gradients up to infinite order, or in an integral (non-local) form, e.g. as a double volume integral summing up the interactions of pairs of mass elements. The linear theory is derived from lattice theory and the following insights have been gained: 1. (1) The differential theory, though in principle applicable to any (analytic) elastic long range problem, is mainly convenient in describing range effects on a very small (nearly atomic) scale. 2. (2) The effects of the electric cohesive forces can be comprised in the two-point material tensors (kernels) of the non-local theory. In this way, the macroscopical theory becomes purely elastic. 3. (3) Van der Waals cohesive forces give rise to elastic range effects under certain inhomogeneous stress conditions, in particular in defect interaction and diffusion problems. {\textcopyright} 1967.},

This continuum model of nonlocal elasticity involves two material length scales which may be derived from atomistics. The new nonlocal kernels are nonsingular in one-, two- and three-dimensions. Furthermore, the nonlocal elasticity of bi-Helmholtz type improves the one of Helmholtz type by predicting a dispersion relationship with zero group velocity at the end of the first Brillouin zone.

  abstract  = {In nonlocal elasticity theory, it is still unclear that whether the nonlocal effect exists or not in the bending of a nano-cantilever beam subjected to a concentrated force at the free end, and whether the equivalent stiffness of nanostructures weakens or strengthens than that predicted by classical theory. Based on the two-dimensional differential constitutive relations of nonlocal elasticity in the plane-stress state, this work derived the governing equation of nanobeams by introducing certain simplifying assumptions. The equation was then applied to the nano-cantilever beam subjected to several typical external forces, and the nonlocal effect on the bending behavior was thus revealed. Moreover, a different solution methodology was proposed in Appendix A to further verify the two-dimensional analyses in the text. It is shown that while nonlocal effect does not show up in the nano-cantilever beam subjected to a concentrated force only, the bending of the beam subjected to general transverse distributed loads is significantly influenced by the nonlocal scale effect factor. It is also demonstrated that the equivalent stiffness of a nanostructure predicted by the nonlocal theory may be larger or smaller than that by the classical theory, depending on the category of applied loads. Results reported in this study could be useful for designing or optimizing nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) where the nano-cantilever beam acts as a basic component.},

The two dominant physical mechanisms that lead to size dependency of elastic behavior at the nanoscale are surface energy effects and nonlocal interactions. The latter arises due to the discrete structure of matter and the fluctuations in the interatomic forces that are smeared out within the phenomenological elastic modulus at coarser sizes. While surface energy effects have been well characterized in the literature, little is known about the length scales at which nonlocal effects manifest for different materials. Using a combination of empirical molecular dynamics and lattice dynamics (empirical and ab initio), we provide estimates of nonlocal elasticity length scales for various classes of materials: semiconductors, metals, amorphous solids, and polymers. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

  abstract  = {A novel mixed finite element formulation for the layerwise analysis of nonlocal multilayered composite plates is presented. The finite elements are formulated starting from the weak form of a set of governing equations for the laminate layers that were deduced via the Reissner Mixed Variational Theorem. The primary variables, namely displacements and out-of-plane stresses, are expressed at layer level as through-the-thickness expansions of suitable selected functions with coefficients approximated by the finite element scheme. The through-the-thickness expansion order is considered as a free parameter. This way, finite elements for different refined higher order plate theories can be systematically developed by assembling the layers contributions associated with the variable expansion terms. These contributions are called fundamental nuclei and their definition is formally unique whatever the considered expansion order. The obtained finite elements inherently ensure stresses and displacements continuity at the layer interfaces and they allow to associate different values of the nonlocal parameter to the laminate layers. Standard 9-node and 16-node isoparametric, quadrilateral finite elements have been implemented to verify the viability of the proposed formulation. The obtained results compare favourably with literature solutions and highlight the characteristics of the approach. Original results are proposed also to serve as benchmarking data.},

  abstract  = {Stress-strain relation in Eringen's nonlocal elasticity theory was originally formulated within the framework of an integral model. Due to difficulty of working with that integral model, the differential model of nonlocal constitutive equation is widely used for nanostructures. However, paradoxical results may be obtained by the differential model for some boundary and loading conditions. Presented in this article is a finite element analysis of Timoshenko nano-beams based on the integral model of nonlocal continuum theory without employing any simplification in the model. The entire procedure of deriving equations of motion is carried out in the matrix form of representation, and hence, they can be easily used in the finite element analysis. For comparison purpose, the differential counterparts of equations are also derived. To study the outcome of analysis based on the integral and differential models, some case studies are presented in which the influences of boundary conditions, nonlocal length scale parameter and loading factor are analyzed. It is concluded that, in contrast to the differential model, there is no paradox in the numerical results of developed integral model of nonlocal continuum theory for different situations of problem characteristics. So, resolving the mentioned paradoxes by means of a purely numerical approach based on the original integral form of nonlocal elasticity theory is the major contribution of present study.},

  abstract        = {The Eringen's fully nonlocal elasticity model is known to lead to ill-posed boundary-value problems and to suffer some boundary effects arising from particle interactions impeded by the body's boundary surface. An enhanced model is derived from the original fully nonlocal one by the addition of a regularizing non-homogeneous local phase which accounts for boundary effects and which leads to a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, hence to well-posed boundary-value problems, without paradoxes, nor other drawbacks. The enhanced integral model applied to a beam in bending proves to be equivalent to a sixth order differential equation with variable coefficients, with extra nonlocality boundary conditions here also derived. Both the integral approach and the differential one lead to a same unique solution of the small-scale beam problem. An efficient numerical algorithm is presented in which the sixth order differential equation with variable coefficients is reduced to one of the second order, which is addressed by a finite difference method. The proposed theory is applied to a set of engineering beam problems, for each of which the inherent size effects are reported and graphically illustrated. The influence of the length scale parameter upon the beam's response is highlighted by means of a function (Formula presented.) representing the normalized maximum deflection of the beam as a function of the length scale parameter. It is shown that the enhanced model always predicts softening size effects no matter the boundary and loading conditions, and that the related response function (Formula presented.) generally exhibits a waved pattern with positive slopes first, then negative, as the length scale parameter increases, with a limit asymptotic behavior like an atomic lattice model. A comparison with other theories is also presented together with possible future developments.},

  abstract = {The Eringen model of nonlocal elasticity is considered and its implications in solid mechanics studied. The model is refined by assuming an attenuation function depending on the 'geodetical distance' between material particles, such that in the diffusion processes of the nonlocality effects certain obstacles as holes or cracks existing in the domain can be circumvented. A suitable thermodynamic framework with nonlocality is also envisaged as a firm basis of the model. The nonlocal elasticity boundary-value problem for infinitesimal displacements and quasi-static loads is addressed and the conditions for the solution uniqueness are established. Three variational principles, nonlocal counterparts of classical ones, i.e. the total potential energy, the complementary energy, and the mixed Hu-Washizu principles, are provided. The former is used to derive a nonlocal-type FEM (NL-FEM) in which the (symmetric) global stiffness matrix reflects the nonlocality features of the problem. An alternative standard-FEM-based solution method is also provided, which consists in an iterative procedure of the type local prediction/nonlocal correction, in which the nonlocality is simulated by an imposed-like correction strain. The potentialities of these analysis methods are pointed out, their numerical implementations being the object of an ongoing research work. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Attention is focused upon the particular case of piecewise homogeneous material. The proposed model is thermodynamically consistent with a suitable free energy potential.

The concept of equivalent distance is introduced to macroscopically account for the further attenuation effects produced by the inhomogeneity upon the long distance interaction forces. With the aid of a piecewise homogeneous bar in tension, a portion of which degrades progressively till failure, it is shown that-under a suitable choice of a material constant-the solution procedure exhibits no pathological features (numerical instability, mesh sensitivity) in every degraded bar condition, including the limit idealized stress-free condition of the failed bar. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract  = {Despite its popularity, differential form of Eringen nonlocal model leads to some inconsistencies that have been demonstrated recently for the cantilever beams by showing the differences between the integral and differential forms of the nonlocal equation, which indicates the importance and necessity of using the original integral model. With this motivation, this paper aims to derive the closed-form analytical solutions of original integral model for static bending of Euler Bernoulli and Timoshenko beams, in a simple manner, for different loading and boundary conditions. For this purpose, the Fredholm type integral governing equations are transformed to Volterra integral equations of the second kind, and Laplace transformation is applied to the corresponding equations. The analytical expressions of the beam deflections which are obtained through the utilization of the proposed solution technique are validated against to those of other studies existing in literature. Furthermore, for all boundary and loading conditions, in contrast to the differential form, it is clearly established that the integral model predicts the softening effect of the nonlocal parameter as expected. In case of Timoshenko beam theory, an additional term that includes the nonlocal parameter is introduced. This extra term is related to the shear rigidity of the beam indicating that the nonlocal effect manifests itself via not only bending, but also shear deformation.},

  abstract = {Scale effect on static deformation of micro- and nano-rods or tubes is revealed through nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and Timoshenko beam theory. Explicit solutions for static deformation of such structures with standard boundary conditions are derived. Results show that the scale effect would not manifest itself for micro-structures with length of the order of micro-meters, however, will be noticeable for nano-structures in their static responses. In addition, the shear effect is evident for nano-structures, especially for carbon nanotubes in most of current references, indicating the importance of applying higher-order beam theory in static analysis of nano-structures. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the free vibration problem for micro/nanobeams modelled after Eringen's nonlocal elasticity theory and Timoshenko beam theory. The small scale effect is taken into consideration in the former theory while the effects of transverse shear deformation and rotary inertia are accounted for in the latter theory. The governing equations and the boundary conditions are derived using Hamilton's principle. These equations are solved analytically for the vibration frequencies of beams with various end conditions. The vibration solutions obtained provide a better representation of the vibration behaviour of short, stubby, micro/nanobeams where the effects of small scale, transverse shear deformation and rotary inertia are significant. The exact vibration solutions should serve as benchmark results for verifying numerically obtained solutions based on other beam models and solution techniques. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Though widely used in modelling nano- and micro- structures, Eringen's differential model shows some inconsistencies and recent study has demonstrated its differences between the integral model, which then implies the necessity of using the latter model. In this paper, an analytical study is taken to analyze static bending of nonlocal Euler-Bernoulli beams using Eringen's two-phase local/nonlocal model. Firstly, a reduction method is proved rigorously, with which the integral equation in consideration can be reduced to a differential equation with mixed boundary value conditions. Then, the static bending problem is formulated and four types of boundary conditions with various loadings are considered. By solving the corresponding differential equations, exact solutions are obtained explicitly in all of the cases, especially for the paradoxical cantilever beam problem. Finally, asymptotic analysis of the exact solutions reveals clearly that, unlike the differential model, the integral model adopted herein has a consistent softening effect. Comparisons are also made with existing analytical and numerical results, which further shows the advantages of the analytical results obtained. Additionally, it seems that the once controversial nonlocal bar problem in the literature is well resolved by the reduction method.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we applied the nonlocal continuum mechanics to deriving a complete and asymptotic representation of the infinite higher-order governing differential equations for nano-beam and nano-plate models. Results show that the vanishing issue of small scale effects under some boundary conditions such as a clamped nano-beam subjected to distributed uniformly load is solved by using the present nonlocal continuum model. Several typical examples for nano-beam and nano-plate are studied and the scale effect on bending deflection is discussed at length. The analytical prediction for nonlocal bending deflection gives a good prediction of molecular dynamics simulation results which confirms the accuracy of the present model. It is found that when the external characteristic length tends to internal characteristic length, a property of a rigid body for the nano-beam and nano-plate is presented.},

  abstract        = {Static bending behavior of functionally graded (FG) Timoshenko beams is studied via both strain- and stress-driven two-phase local/nonlocal mixed integral models based on the bi-Helmholtz kernel. The differential governing equations and boundary conditions are derived via the principle of minimum potential energy, the relations between strain and nonlocal stress are expressed as integral equations with the bi-Helmholtz kernel. The Laplace transform technique is utilized to obtain closed-form solutions for the first time. The numerical results are validated by reverting to the local case, and it is concluded that the present model shows well-posedness for exploring bounded beams in contrast to Eringen's pure nonlocal model: for all boundary and loading conditions, the increasing nonlocal length-scale parameter shows consistently softening or stiffening effect on the beam behaviour, according to the strain- or the stress-driven model, respectively. Moreover, the effects of shear-deformation and FG characteristics are also investigated. As the FG parameter increases, the non-dimensional deflection increases, while the softening effect caused by the strain-driven nonlocal phase seems to be more significant.},

  abstract = {A size-dependent integral elasticity model is developed for a small-scaled rod in tension based on the nonlocal strain gradient theory. The integral rod model contains a nonlocal parameter and a material length scale parameter to incorporate the scaling effects of nonlocal stress and microstructure-dependent strain gradient. In comparison to size-dependent differential models, the developed integral rod model is both self-consistent and well-posed. The governing equations and boundary conditions for the nonlocal strain gradient rod in tension are derived by employing the principle of virtual work. In addition to the classical natural and essential boundary conditions, non-classical natural and essential boundary conditions are present for the integral rod model. The closed-form solutions for predicting the displacement and reduced Young's modulus are derived for four types of boundary conditions. It is shown explicitly that the integral rod model can exert stiffness-softening and stiffness-hardening effects by considering various values of size-dependent parameters and boundary conditions. It is found that, the developed rods with four different boundary conditions can predict the scaling effects of the Young's modulus of single-walled carbon nanotube, and the scaling effects are more sensitive to the size-dependent parameters (the material length scale parameter and the nonlocal parameter) in comparison with the non-classical boundary conditions.},
